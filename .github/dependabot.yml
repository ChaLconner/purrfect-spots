# Dependabot configuration - DISABLED
# Dependabot has been disabled to prevent excessive CI/CD workflow runs
# that consume Vercel deployment limits.
#
# Dependencies should be updated manually when needed:
#   Backend:  pip install --upgrade <package> && pip freeze > requirements.txt
#   Frontend: npm update && npm audit fix
#
# To re-enable, uncomment the configuration below and adjust schedule/limits.
